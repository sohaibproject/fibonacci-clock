# Fibonacci Clock Application

## Overview

This Proportional Fibonacci Clock is a unique digital clock application that represents time using the Fibonacci sequence. The UI consists of five squares, each sized based on Fibonacci numbers. Each square changes color dynamically to represent hours, minutes, or both: red for hours, green for minutes, and blue when both overlap. The app offers buttons to increment or decrement time in 5-minute intervals, allowing users to visually explore how time is displayed using Fibonacci decomposition. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, the clock combines mathematical concepts with an interactive visual experience.


## Technologies Used
